# United States Drug Arrests
## Motivating Question
I was recently watching the show Narcos on Netflix and it made me curious about the effectiveness of the War on Drugs in the United States. 
For this project, I am analyzing drug arrest data from 1994 to 2016 in the United States.
The main question that I set out to answer at the start of this project is this: Does the number of manufacturing arrests impact the amount of possession arrests? 
If an increase in the number of manufacturing arrests leads to a decrease in possession arrests, then the government is winning the War on Drugs.
## Data Source
I sourced my data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics database.
